# fileinterpreter
This is a small project I made for school that is able to take a txt or csv input and can calculate the mean, median, sum, product, standard deviation, frequency list, and mode of said file. One limitation is that each item must be separated by a comma in order for it to be considered a unique input. Uses the tkinter api
There is an exmaple input data file named Input Data.txt. It is located whithin the project folder
